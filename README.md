# Treasury Management DAO

This project provides a decentralized application (DApp) for managing and automating treasury operations of a DAO using Ethereum smart contracts. It integrates ERC-7579 standards with advanced scheduling and querying capabilities, leveraging Safe, The Graph, and other blockchain technologies to create a robust treasury management solution.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Utilize smart contracts to manage treasury operations safely and efficiently.
- **Scheduled Transactions**: Automate transactions based on specific criteria and schedules.
- **Querying Blockchain Data**: Leverage The Graph for efficient data retrieval and state tracking.
- **Modular Architecture**: Built using Next.js, integrating various blockchain technologies into a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Safe**: Manage treasury operations securely.
- **ERC-7579 (Smart Modular Account)**: Adopting standards for permissionless accounts.
- **Rhinestone & Pimlico**: Optimizing transaction bundling and gas management.
- **The Graph**: For decentralized querying of Ethereum data.
- **Next.js**: Server-side rendering and static generation for React applications.
- **GraphQL**: Data querying language used in conjunction with The Graph.
